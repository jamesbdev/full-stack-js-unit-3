### Exceeds grade points:

#### Real-time validation

For the email input, I added real time validation. When the user starts to add information to the email input, it will validate what the user is inputing using the 'keyup' event on the email input.

#### Extra validation message

On the credit card number field, I have added a first hint that says "Please add a credit card number" if the field is blank when submitting the form. This hint gets replaced when the user enters a value in the input field on form submission.
