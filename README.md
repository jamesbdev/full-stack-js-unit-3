Real time validation for exceeds grade: 

For the email input, I added real time validation. When the user starts to add information to the email input, it will validate what the user is inputing using the 'keyup' event on the email input.

Helpful validation message for exceeds grade:
Also on the email input, when submitting the form, I have added a first hint that says "Please add an email address" if the field is blank. This message gets hidden when the user starts entering a value.
